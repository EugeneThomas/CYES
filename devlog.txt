============================================================

ngoS, panC, thomasE, zhangY -- 2017-11-13 13:18
All members discussed possible project ideas. The majority of the day was used to research on APIs and see what was most reasonable. Assigned general positions.

ngoS, panC, thomasE, zhangY -- 2017-11-14 13:18
Members of the team pinned down of project ideas. Expanded on decision for leisure/weather project.

thomasE -- 2017-11-15 13:18
As Project Manager, this member delegated all of the roles to the team.

ngoS -- 2017-11-15 13:18
This group member is in charge of back end programming and the handling of the APIs.

panC -- 2017-11-15 13:18
This group member is in charge of back end programming and the handling of databases.

zhangY -- 2017-11-15 13:18
This group member is in charge of front end programming, especially the handling of design, Jinja, and Bootstrap/HTML

zhangY -- 2017-11-16 21:52
As a part of the design document, this group member created a site map for the website and began handling design duties such as creating a logo for the homepage.

panC -- 2017-11-16 21:54
As a part of the design document, this group member created a component map and a database schema.

ngoS -- 2017-11-16 21:55
As a part of the design document, this group member began to research each of the APIs we are using. Also, she was able to procure the true keys to success: API keys.

thomasE -- 2017-11-16 21:56
As project manager, this group member ensure the entire design document was finished, writing the abstract and jobs sections. Also, the PM was updating the devlog as of writing this and is ready to push all of the work for the night.

zhangY —- 2017-11-17 11:00
Began planning out bootstrap and grid system for website. Reviewed design plan to update charts.

zhangY —- 2017-19-17 23:15
Updated site map to be in conditions of current plan. Updated base.html to incorporate bootstrap

ngoS, panC, thomasE, zhangY -- 2017-11-21 13:18
Developed our finalized plan for the project. For tonight, skeletons pertaining to the project should be made for the templates as well as the app.py flask file.
Some of the biggest breakthroughs we had today included:
1. The ditching of our idea of caching data (it would not be logical since the temperature is subject to change and a lot of the leisure activities you can do are dependent on weather.
2. Our logo for our website has changed to a more abstract and geometric interpretation of a sun!
3. API keys now have an appropriate text file and will be read by app.py

ngoS, panC, thomasE -- 2017-11-22 13:00
Fixed up the design document for the first half of class, ensuring that the root directory of the repo had the most updated version. In addition, “THE PLAN” page in our shared Google Drive folder was updated, detailing what we have to do in order to complete the project as well as additional and optional tasks we can undertake as well.

ngoS -- 2017-11-22 13:17
For the remaining portion of class, this member did research on the event APIs and asked a very important question: since there exists an SDK (software development kit) for EventBrite, are we allowed to use it?

panC -- 2017-11-22 13:17
For the remainder of the period, this member did more research on the Weather Channel/Wunderground APIs, comparing and contrasting the two.

thomasE -- 2017-11-22 13:17
For the remainder of the period, the project manager answered questions from both Mr. Brown and his groupmates. Also, the project manager made sure that the repo was as updated as possible, with all of the most up-to-date files in the repo by the end of the period.

zhangY -- 2017-11-22 13:17
For the entirety of the period, continued to work on the front end of the webpage, comparing and contrasting different stylistic choices in bootstrap while trying to make the front end of the code come to life.

panC -- 2017-11-22 22:05
Procured api keys to be tested and successfully made api calls using those keys (code for these actions have been placed in util/api_calls.py). Created super basic homepage that asks for zipcode and age. Made basic template that displayed resulting information, such as the weather and recommended books. Both templates are to be replaced at a later date. Updated README.md so the functionality at this moment is available for use.

zhangY —- 2017-11-25 23:00
Updated radio buttons and forms in base.html to be under one submit button. Incorporated a bit of jinja to personalize it for the user. Updated info.html to incorporate bootstrap.

zhangY —- 2017-11-26 22:10
Added an error page to catch errors when user passes their quota for API keys.

ngoS —- 2017-11-26 22:40
Got working version up and running; updated api_calls.py to match new API keys arrangement; fixing up bootstrap.

panC, thomasE, zhangY -- 2017-11-27 13:13
In the wake of the absence of NGO, the remainder of the group worked to tie up any loose ends that plagued the "finished" version of our project that we had ready for class today.
Working together, we were able to finally create a page that takes in an age and a zip code and sends back book reviews, and the weather in that area. For the next two days, we will extend the site to the EventBrite API and robust our code with comments.

zhangY —- 2017-11-27 22:00
Tested a color scheme with gold and white. Attempted to fix form.

thomasE -- 2017-11-28 02:22
In a late night coding session, the Project Manager helped tie up some loose ends in the code and is now ready to get some sleep.

ngoS, panC, thomasE, zhangY -- 2017-11-28 13:17
In the last class meeting before the project is due, our group reunited in order to work on the error handling for the issues that we currently have. For tonight, we will all be coding diligently in order to manage any error handling possible. Also, we must know how to handle the EventBrite API by the end of the night. This will be a journey, but we will overcome it.

panC -- 2017-11-28 18:35
Set up event page, acquired month, day, year, zipcode, and temperature in preparation for the EventBrite API. 

zhangY —- 2017-11-28 22:08
Added bootstrap to both books.html and events.html. Changed color scheme once again to incorporate a more colorful theme. Added gradient for a better color contrast. Updated error page to facilitate possible errors during running.

ngoS -- 2017-11-28 23:45
Fixed bugs on weather added try-except blocks.

ngoS -- 2017-11-29-05:45
Added events API and able to display five events if temperature is greater than certain temperature.

/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Accounts -> ultimately decided not to do them
- Weather API not finding location -> use zipcode only
- Events -> no way to show trending events -- used a search query to find "outdoor" events
- too many things returned -> used filters

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- How to use APIs!

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Got rid of accounts
- decided not to use movie API

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
panC -- Please start asking what the code does before deleting. And I also have to work on commenting.
